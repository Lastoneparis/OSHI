💡 Support the Oshi Mesh & IPFS Project

Oshi Mesh is an open, decentralized infrastructure project built on IPFS — aiming to make peer-to-peer networking more accessible, censorship-resistant, and sustainable.

This project is developed independently, and I’m currently self-funding all development and maintenance costs. If you’d like to help support continued progress, you can contribute directly with Bitcoin:

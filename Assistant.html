OSHI Support & Documentation
Welcome to OSHI - Truly Private Messaging
This page provides support information and documentation for the OSHI messaging app.

📱 About OSHI
OSHI is a revolutionary private messaging app that combines military-grade encryption with decentralized networks. Your conversations stay private, secure, and accessible even offline.
Key Features

End-to-End Encryption: Double Ratchet protocol (Signal protocol)
Three Delivery Modes: Local mesh, IPFS cloud, Tor network
No Registration: No phone number or email required
Truly Private: No data collection, no metadata, no surveillance
Offline Capable: Communicate via local mesh network without Internet
Open Source: Transparent and auditable code


🚀 Getting Started
First Time Setup

Download OSHI from the App Store
Open the app - No registration required!
Your identity is created automatically using cryptographic keys
Start messaging by scanning a contact's QR code

Adding Contacts

Tap the "Add Contact" button
Scan their QR code with your camera
Start chatting securely!

To share your QR code:

Go to Settings
Tap "My QR Code"
Let others scan it


🔐 Security & Privacy
Encryption Technology
OSHI uses the Double Ratchet protocol (the same protocol used by Signal) which provides:

Forward Secrecy: Past messages remain secure even if current keys are compromised
Post-Compromise Security: Automatic recovery if keys are stolen
Unique Keys: Each message encrypted with its own unique key

Cryptographic Algorithms

Key Exchange: Curve25519 (ECDH)
Message Encryption: AES-256-GCM
Key Derivation: HKDF-SHA256
Signatures: Ed25519

All cryptography is implemented using Apple's CryptoKit framework.
Privacy Guarantees
✅ No phone number required
✅ No email required
✅ No personal data collected
✅ No metadata stored
✅ No message analysis
✅ No server access to your messages
✅ No backdoors

📡 Delivery Methods
1. Local Mesh (Direct) 🔵

Direct iPhone-to-iPhone communication
No Internet needed
Range: Up to 100 meters
Perfect for: Events, protests, areas without network
Uses: Apple's Multipeer Connectivity

2. IPFS Cloud (Decentralized) ☁️

Distributed storage on IPFS network
Censorship-resistant
No central server
Available worldwide
Automatic fallback when mesh is unavailable

3. Tor Network (Anonymous) 🧅

Complete anonymity
Protection against surveillance
No location tracking
Routes through Tor network

Messages automatically switch between delivery methods based on availability.

❓ Frequently Asked Questions
General Questions
Q: Do I need to create an account?
A: No! OSHI generates a cryptographic identity automatically. No registration required.
Q: Can OSHI read my messages?
A: No! All messages are end-to-end encrypted. Only you and your recipient can read them.
Q: Do you collect my data?
A: No! We collect zero personal data. No phone number, no email, no tracking.
Q: Is OSHI really open source?
A: Yes! Our code is available on GitHub for anyone to audit.
Q: Can I use OSHI without Internet?
A: Yes! The local mesh mode works directly between iPhones without any network.
Technical Questions
Q: What encryption does OSHI use?
A: Double Ratchet protocol (Signal protocol) with AES-256-GCM and Curve25519.
Q: Is OSHI compatible with Signal/WhatsApp?
A: No, OSHI is a separate network. You need OSHI on both devices.
Q: How long are messages stored?
A: Messages are stored locally on your device. Cloud messages on IPFS are available for 30 days, then automatically deleted.
Q: Can I export my messages?
A: Currently messages are stored only on your device. Backup features coming soon.
Q: What is IPFS?
A: InterPlanetary File System - a decentralized storage network. No single company controls it.

🐛 Troubleshooting
Messages Not Sending
Problem: Messages stuck in "Sending..." status
Solutions:

Check your Internet connection (for IPFS mode)
Make sure you're within range (for mesh mode - 100m)
Try force-closing and reopening the app
Check if recipient is online

Can't Scan QR Code
Problem: Camera won't scan contact's QR code
Solutions:

Grant camera permission in Settings → OSHI → Camera
Ensure good lighting
Hold phone steady and centered on the QR code
Make sure QR code is fully visible on screen

Messages Showing as Encrypted
Problem: Messages appear as encrypted text instead of plaintext
Solutions:

This is a temporary sync issue
Both users should:

Go to Settings → Advanced
Tap "Clear Session Keys"
Send a fresh message


The issue should resolve automatically after a few messages

App Crashes or Freezes
Solutions:

Force close the app and reopen
Restart your iPhone
Check for app updates in the App Store
If problem persists, contact support (see below)


🔧 Advanced Features
Session Management
OSHI maintains cryptographic sessions with each contact. If you experience decryption issues:

Go to Settings → Advanced
Tap "Clear Session Keys"
Send a new message to re-establish the session

Note: Clearing sessions does not delete your message history.
Mesh Network Settings
Customize your mesh network experience:

Discovery: Enable/disable automatic peer discovery
Range: Adjust Bluetooth range (affects battery life)
Auto-connect: Automatically connect when peers are nearby

IPFS Gateway Selection
OSHI uses multiple IPFS gateways for redundancy:

ipfs.io
cloudflare-ipfs.com
gateway.pinata.cloud
dweb.link

The app automatically tries different gateways if one is unavailable.

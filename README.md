OSHI - The Sovereign Messenger

Decentralized, end-to-end encrypted messaging without servers

OSHI is a proof-of-concept secure messenger that works offline using peer-to-peer mesh networking. Built on principles of digital sovereignty, privacy, and resilience.

üîê Security Features

Signal Double Ratchet Protocol - Industry-standard E2E encryption Wallet-Based Identity - Ethereum/Solana cryptographic keys Peer-to-Peer Mesh - Direct Bluetooth/WiFi connections Multi-Hop Routing - Messages relay through trusted peers Perfect Forward Secrecy - Past messages stay secure Out-of-Order Handling - Robust mesh message decryption Encrypted IPFS Fallback - Decentralized cloud backup

## 🔐 What is OSHI?

**OSHI** is a zero-knowledge encrypted messenger designed for people who refuse to compromise on privacy. Unlike mainstream messengers that require your phone number, harvest metadata, and depend on centralized servers, OSHI takes a fundamentally different approach:

- **No phone number, no email** — create an account with nothing but a username
- **End-to-end encrypted by default** — every message, every call, every time
- **Works offline** — communicate directly over Bluetooth and WiFi mesh networks
- **Zero metadata** — we cannot see who talks to whom, when, or how often
- **Open source** — every line of cryptographic code is auditable right here

OSHI is built for journalists, activists, security professionals, and anyone living in or traveling to regions where private communication is a matter of safety — not convenience.

---

## 🌟 Core Features

### 🔒 End-to-End Encryption

OSHI implements the **Signal Protocol (Double Ratchet)** with modern cryptographic primitives:

| Component | Algorithm |
|-----------|-----------|
| Key Exchange | **X25519** (Curve25519 ECDH) |
| Message Encryption | **AES-256-GCM** |
| Ratchet Protocol | **Double Ratchet** (Signal Protocol) |
| Key Derivation | **HKDF-SHA256** |

Every message generates new encryption keys through the ratchet mechanism, providing **forward secrecy** and **break-in recovery**. Even if a key is compromised, past and future messages remain protected.

---

### 📡 Mesh Networking

OSHI creates direct peer-to-peer connections between devices using **Bluetooth LE** and **WiFi Direct** — no internet required.

- **Range**: ~100 meters between devices
- **Automatic peer discovery**: devices find each other without manual configuration
- **Multi-hop relay**: messages can route through intermediate peers
- **Zero server dependency**: local messages never touch a server

Perfect for concerts, protests, disaster zones, remote areas, or any situation where internet access is unavailable or compromised.

---

### 🎭 Steganography (NEW)

OSHI introduces **military-grade steganography** — the ability to hide secret messages inside ordinary-looking content. This is a first for any mainstream messenger.

#### HUGO Algorithm — Image Steganography
Hide encrypted messages inside normal photographs. The embedded data is statistically undetectable, even under forensic analysis. Recipients extract the hidden message; everyone else sees a regular photo.

#### Text Steganography
Embed secret messages using **zero-width Unicode characters** within ordinary text. The message looks completely normal to anyone reading it — the hidden payload is invisible to the human eye.

#### 6 Covert Channel Families
OSHI implements six distinct families of network covert channels for censorship bypass in hostile network environments:

- Timing-based channels
- Protocol header manipulation
- DNS covert channels
- HTTP field encoding
- Packet size modulation
- Traffic pattern mimicry

These channels allow OSHI to function even when deep packet inspection (DPI) is actively blocking encrypted messenger traffic.

---

### 🤖 Bot API (NEW)

Build automation on top of OSHI with a **Telegram-like Bot API**. Create bots that can:

- Send messages to groups and channels
- Respond to commands
- Run on schedules (cron-style)
- Moderate content
- Integrate with external services via webhooks

A complete **Python SDK** is included in the [`sdk/`](sdk/) directory. See the [Bot SDK](#-bot-sdk) section below for a quick start.

---

### 🧠 AI Offline (NEW)

OSHI integrates **Apple Intelligence** for on-device natural language processing on iOS 26+:

- **Smart text corrections** — grammar and style suggestions without sending text to the cloud
- **Translation** — 16+ languages, processed entirely on-device
- **Contextual suggestions** — intelligent replies powered by on-device NLP
- **Zero cloud dependency** — all AI processing happens on your device's Neural Engine

Your conversations are never analyzed by external servers. Intelligence stays local.

---

### 📞 Encrypted Voice Calls

Real-time voice calls with full end-to-end encryption:

- **CallKit integration** — native iOS call UI and experience
- **Voice effects** — optional voice modification for identity protection
- **Works over mesh or internet** — adaptive routing
- **China-compliant** — compatible with MIIT regulations for users in mainland China

---

### 🌐 IPFS & Tor Integration

When direct communication isn't possible, OSHI falls back to decentralized infrastructure:

- **IPFS** — messages stored on a decentralized network, no single point of failure
- **Tor routing** — optional onion routing for maximum anonymity
- **30-day ephemeral storage** — messages automatically expire from IPFS nodes
- **Censorship-resistant** — no central server to block or seize

---

### 💨 Disappearing Messages

Control the lifecycle of every message you send:

- **View-once** — message is destroyed after a single viewing
- **Auto-delete timers** — set messages to disappear after minutes, hours, or days
- **Screenshot blocking** — prevents screen capture on the recipient's device
- **No forensic traces** — securely wiped from device storage

## 🏗️ Architecture

OSHI is built as a native iOS application in Swift, with a decentralized backend architecture. For the complete technical deep-dive, see [Architecture.md](Architecture.md).

## 🤖 Bot SDK

The OSHI Bot SDK lets you build bots in Python that interact with OSHI groups and channels — similar to Telegram's Bot API.

### Installation

```bash
# Download the SDK
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lastoneparis/OSHI/main/sdk/oshi_bot.py
```

Or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lastoneparis/OSHI.git
cd OSHI/sdk
```

### Quick Start

```python
from oshi_bot import OshiBot

# Initialize with your bot token (created in the OSHI app)
bot = OshiBot(token="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")

# Send a message to a group
bot.send("GROUP_ID", "Hello from my OSHI bot!")
```

### Creating a Bot

1. Open the OSHI app
2. Navigate to **Portal > Bots > Create**
3. Copy the bot token
4. Assign the bot to a group
5. Use the SDK to send messages

### Bot Types

- **Webhook bots** — respond to incoming messages in real time
- **Scheduled bots** — send messages on a cron schedule
- **Moderator bots** — automate group moderation
- **Integration bots** — bridge OSHI with external services

## 🛡️ Security

OSHI's security model is designed around a single principle: **we cannot read your messages, even if compelled by law**. We have zero access to plaintext content, encryption keys, or social graphs.

Key properties:

- **Zero knowledge** — the server never sees plaintext or keys
- **Forward secrecy** — compromising a key does not expose past messages
- **Break-in recovery** — the ratchet automatically heals after a compromise
- **No metadata** — we do not log who communicates with whom
- **Open source** — audit the cryptographic implementation yourself

For the full security model, threat analysis, and cryptographic specifications, see:

- [**Security.md**](Security.md) — Security model and responsible disclosure
- [**docs/encryption.md**](docs/encryption.md) — Cryptographic protocol details
- [**docs/protocol.md**](docs/protocol.md) — Communication protocol specification
